# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the Back-End to my project: WTWT (What to Wear?).
For Sprint 12, I am learning back-end development, specifically understanding databases, security, and using my machine as a server. Eventually I'll create a server with API/User authorization

For Sprint 13, I am learning back-end development for API/User authorization as well as adding, deleting, and authroizing clothing item per the owner.
